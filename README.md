# Challenge 1

## Description

This project is the first challenge in our bootcamp course. It involved refracting a starter code into a more condensed, developer friendly format, while keeping the look of the website the same. Modifying this code will make it easier for developers to work on it in the future, as it now follows the best practice standards regarding HTML and CSS style sheets. In analyzing and editing this code, I learned to look for issues HTML element structure, repeating patterns in CSS, unneccessary attributes, and more.
